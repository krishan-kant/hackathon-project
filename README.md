# Hackathon Projects

## 1. Real-time object tracking
Object tracking allows the user to specify an object in the image that the camera has to follow from an approximate constant distance. 
When used with human detection, it can help in babysitting and watching over elderly people.

  Technologies used: OpenCV, Haarcascade, Arduino uno board, Servo motors, WebCam.


## 2. OCR
Sometimes we want to know more on a topic on the newspaper or watch a video related to the news.
We might require more knowledge on a topic in the book and need to search relevant information or video on the topic.
The project tries to automate these tasks.

  Technologies used: OpenCV, PyTesseract, Beautiful Soup 4, Webcam.
